- `GET /api/nodes/{type}` - Specific entity type
  - Types: `distribution_centers`, `stores`, `trucks`, `purchase_orders`, `shipments`, `inventory`, `returns`, `weather_alerts`, `events`, `skus`

### Analytics
- `GET /api/summary` - Summary statistics
- `GET /api/relationships` - Entity relationships

### Examples
```bash
# Get all distribution centers
curl http://localhost:8000/api/nodes/distribution_centers

# Get supply chain summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/summary

# Get all active events
curl http://localhost:8000/api/nodes/events
```
